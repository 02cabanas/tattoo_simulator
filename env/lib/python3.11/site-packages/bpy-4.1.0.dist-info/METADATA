# Blender

[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing.

This package provides Blender as a Python module for use in studio pipelines, web services, scientific research, and more.
